 Angular project for my exam at SoftUni August 2021
 
 This is an e-commerce shop that is focused on offering and providing products related to a healthy lifestyle.
 There are different categories that you can select from, as well as top products.
 The user is able to add and remove items from his cart, see the current bill and more. The routes that are related to the user's cart and added items are protected with Route Guards.
 
 I have followed the basic principles of Material Design for Angular. The themes, color palletes, fonts and components were selected following the guides of the documentation. The selection emphasizes the unique design that the application offers. Another useful tool to create different quality backgrounds for each component and module is - Hiakei https://app.haikei.app/
 
 The user is able to register with an email and password or directly via Google.
 
 I'm using Firebase for Backend-as-a-Service. The Authentication is handled with Firabase also, as it's a nice solution to Manage users, signin, login and password recovering. This service also offers a Realtime database and the documentation provides built-in helper methods to handle CRUD operations and edit the DB.
